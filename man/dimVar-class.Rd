\title{S4 class describing a dimVar-object}
\description{
An object of class \code{dimVar} holds all necessary information about a single
dimensional variable such as original and standardized codes, the level-structure,
the hierarchical structure, codes that may be (temporarily) removed from
building the complete hierarchy (dups) and their corresponding codes that correspond
to these duplicated codes.
}
\details{
\describe{
\item{slot \code{codesOriginal}:}{a character vector (or NULL) holding original variable codes}
\item{slot \code{codesDefault}:}{a character vector (or NULL) holding standardized codes}
\item{slot \code{codesMinimal}:}{a logical vector (or NULL) defining if a code is required to build the complete hierarchy or not (then the code is a (sub)total)}
\item{slot \code{vName}:}{character vector of length 1 (or NULL) defining the variable name of the dimensional variable}
\item{slot \code{levels}:}{a numeric vector (or NULL) defining the level structure. For each code the corresponding level is listed with the grand-total always having level==1}
\item{slot \code{structure}:}{a numeric vector (or NULL) with length of the total number of levels. Each element shows how many digits the i-th level allocates within the standardized codes (note: level 1 always allocates exactly 1 digit in the standardized codes)}
\item{slot \code{dims}:}{a list (or NULL) defining the hierarchical structure of the dimensional variable. Each list-element is a character vector with elements available in slot \code{codesDefault} and the first element always being a (sub)total and the remaining elements being the codes that contribute to the (sub)total}
\item{slot \code{dups}:}{character vector (or NULL) having showing original codes that are duplicates in the hierarchy and can temporarily removed when building a table with this dimensional variable }
\item{slot \code{dupsUp}:}{character vector (or NULL) with original codes that are the corresponding upper-levels to the codes that may be removed because they are duplicates and that are listed in slot \code{dups}}
}
}
\note{
objects of class \code{dimVar} form the base for elements in slot \code{dimInfo} of class \code{dimInfo}.
